    "description": "Retrieves relevant context from your documents to answer questions accurately.",
    "long_description": "The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent combines the power of a large language model with your own document knowledge base. It first searches your documents for relevant information, then uses that information to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to your questions. This approach ensures that responses are grounded in your specific documents rather than the model's general knowledge, making it ideal for questions about your organization's specific policies, procedures, and compliance requirements.",

      {
        "question": "How does the RAG Agent differ from regular AI chat?",
        "answer": "Regular AI chat draws from the model's general training data, which doesn't include your specific documents. The RAG Agent specifically retrieves information from your uploaded documents and uses that as context for generating responses, ensuring answers are based on your organization's specific content."

        "question": "Can I use the RAG Agent with documents in languages other than English?",
        "answer": "Yes, the system supports multiple languages. Document processing, embedding, and retrieval work across languages, though performance may vary depending on the language."

      {
        "question": "How can I improve the quality of responses?",
        "answer": "Upload high-quality, well-structured documents. Break large documents into logical sections. Use specific queries with relevant keywords. Adjust the top_k parameter for broader or narrower context retrieval. Consider hybrid search for term-specific queries."

      {
        "question": "How accurate are the framework mappings?",
        "answer": "Mappings are based on the agent's analysis of control objectives, requirements, and your uploaded compliance documentation. While generally reliable, all mappings should be reviewed by qualified compliance professionals before implementation."
