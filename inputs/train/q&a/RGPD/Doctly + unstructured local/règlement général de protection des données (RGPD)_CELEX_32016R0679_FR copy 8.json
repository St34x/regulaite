    "question": "What elements must be included in the records of processing activities maintained by data controllers under GDPR?",
    "target": "According to Article 30 of GDPR, controllers must maintain records including: contact details of the controller and DPO, purposes of processing, categories of data subjects and personal data, categories of recipients, international transfers details (if applicable), envisaged retention periods, and a general description of technical and organizational security measures. This documentation must be in written form (including electronic) and made available to supervisory authorities upon request. Organizations with fewer than 250 employees have limited exemptions unless processing poses risks, is not occasional, or involves special categories of data."
    }, {
    "question": "Under what circumstances must an organization appoint a Data Protection Officer?",
    "target": "According to Article 37, a DPO must be appointed when: 1) processing is carried out by a public authority (except courts acting in judicial capacity); 2) core activities require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale; or 3) core activities consist of large-scale processing of special categories of data or criminal conviction data. The DPO must have expert knowledge of data protection law and practices, can be a staff member or contractor, and must report to the highest management level while maintaining independence in their role."
    }, {
    "question": "What security measures does the GDPR require organizations to implement?",
    "target": "Article 32 requires appropriate technical and organizational measures including: 1) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data; 2) ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems; 3) ability to restore availability and access to data in a timely manner after incidents; and 4) processes for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating security measure effectiveness. These requirements should be implemented based on risk assessment, accounting for the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing as well as the likelihood and severity of risks to individuals' rights."
    }, {
    "question": "What are the data breach notification requirements under GDPR?",
    "target": "Under Articles 33 and 34, controllers must notify the supervisory authority of breaches within 72 hours of discovery (when feasible), unless the breach is unlikely to risk individuals' rights. The notification must include the nature of the breach, DPO contact details, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed. High-risk breaches require notification to affected individuals without undue delay. Notification to individuals isn't required if data is unintelligible (e.g., encrypted), subsequent measures mitigate the high risk, or it would involve disproportionate effort (requiring public communication instead). All breaches must be documented, including facts, effects, and remedial actions."
    }, {
    "question": "When is a Data Protection Impact Assessment required, and what must it include?",
    "target": "Under Article 35, a DPIA is required when processing likely creates high risk to individuals, particularly with new technologies. It's specifically required for: 1) automated processing including profiling that produces legal effects; 2) large-scale processing of special categories of data; or 3) systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas on a large scale. A DPIA must include: a systematic description of processing operations and purposes, necessity and proportionality assessment, risk assessment regarding individuals' rights, and measures to address those risks. Controllers must consult the supervisory authority prior to processing if high risks cannot be sufficiently mitigated."
    }, {
    "question": "What legal mechanisms allow personal data transfers to countries outside the EU?",
    "target": "GDPR provides several transfer mechanisms in Articles 44-49: 1) Adequacy decisions from the Commission; 2) Appropriate safeguards without specific authorization - including binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses, approved codes of conduct, or certification mechanisms with binding commitments; 3) Appropriate safeguards requiring authorization - including contractual clauses or administrative arrangements between public authorities; 4) Derogations for specific situations - such as explicit consent, contract necessity, important public interest, legal claims, vital interests, or transfers from public registers. Limited transfers may also be possible based on compelling legitimate interests when no other mechanism is available, provided strict conditions are met."
    }, {
    "question": "How can organizations demonstrate compliance with GDPR through certification?",
    "target": "Articles 42-43 establish voluntary certification mechanisms, data protection seals, and marks that demonstrate GDPR compliance. Certification is issued by accredited certification bodies or competent supervisory authorities for up to three years and can be renewed. While certification doesn't reduce compliance responsibility, it helps demonstrate implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures. Certification bodies must meet independence and expertise requirements and establish procedures for issuing, reviewing, and withdrawing certifications. All approved certification mechanisms are published in a public registry maintained by the European Data Protection Board."
    }, {
    "question": "What is the role of the Data Protection Officer according to GDPR?",
    "target": "According to Articles 38-39, the DPO's duties include: 1) informing and advising the organization and employees about GDPR obligations; 2) monitoring compliance with GDPR and internal data protection policies; 3) providing advice on data protection impact assessments; 4) cooperating with supervisory authorities; and 5) acting as a contact point for authorities on processing issues. The DPO must be properly supported with resources to perform their duties, have direct reporting to highest management, and maintain independence without receiving instructions on how to perform their tasks. They cannot be dismissed or penalized for performing their duties and may perform other tasks if no conflicts of interest arise."
    }, {
    "question": "What obligations do organizations have regarding cooperation with supervisory authorities?",
    "target": "Article 31 requires controllers, processors, and their representatives to cooperate with supervisory authorities in performing their tasks when requested. Organizations must provide access to necessary information, respond to inquiries, and facilitate supervisory actions including audits and investigations. They must make processing records available to authorities upon request (Article 30) and conduct prior consultation for certain high-risk processing (Article 36). Failure to cooperate can result in administrative fines up to â‚¬20 million or 4% of global annual turnover, whichever is higher."
    }, {
    "question": "What are the primary considerations when conducting international data transfers under GDPR?",
    "target": "According to Article 44, all provisions in Chapter V must be applied to ensure that the level of protection guaranteed by GDPR is not undermined when data is transferred internationally. Organizations must verify if the destination country has an adequacy decision (Article 45) or implement appropriate safeguards (Article 46). In absence of these, they must rely on specific derogations (Article 49) which have strict conditions for use. Transfer assessment documentation should be maintained in processing records. Organizations must also account for potential access by foreign governments, and in some cases may need to implement supplementary measures beyond standard contractual clauses to ensure essentially equivalent protection."
